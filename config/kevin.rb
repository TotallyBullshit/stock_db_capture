# This file specifies all of the requisite information to perform one backtest. The declarations
# serve the following purposes:
#
#   analytics - section which describes the conditions underwhich trades can occur. In this
#               block the following "verbs" are supported:
#       * open_position - describes the conditions underwhich a position will be openned.
#                         It takes three arguments:
#                           - the symbol name of this block, used as the means by which the
#                             information given is name, stored and retrieved fro the database.
#                           - the paramaters passed in to the block (the part that comes after the "do"
#                           - a block of ruby code that will get executed on every stock
#                             in the population to which is "verb" is applied.
#
#   populations - a section that describes the characteristics of named populations. In
#                 this block a set of "scans" are defined which determine characteristics
#                 of the population name.
#
#   backtests - this is where an association is made between an analytic component  and
#               the population to which that analysis is to be applied. The "verbs"
#               supported in this section are:
#       * apply - the declaration making the association beteen an analysis and
#                 a population. It takes three arguments:
#                   - the symbolic name of an anaylsis define in the "analytics"
#                     section.
#                   - the name of a population to which the analysis is to be
#                     applied.
#                   - a block of code which is executed for every DB record
#                     generated by applying the analysis to every timeseries
#                     in the specified population.
#
# In this example backtest specification, three analysis are defined, each with different
# criterion for openning a positiion. One population is defined which essentially describes
# all liquid stocks for the year 2008. One backtest is defined which opens positions
# when the conditions described for :rsi_oversold are met on all liquid stocks in 2008.
# Further, for each position openned, that position is closed by semantics of "close_at_max"
# which is a method which closes positions on the day of the close where the maximum ROI
# achievable withing the holding time of 1 to 10 trading days.
