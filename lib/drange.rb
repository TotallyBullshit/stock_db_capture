# DRange -- Discontinuous range. Acts like a range but requires a step parameter to be
#                  given. The class will return values from min to max depending on which is
#                  greater in increments of the step arg up to the limit. Class includes
#                  Enumerable allowing all methods from that module (map, collect, etc..)
